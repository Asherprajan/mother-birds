# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Version Compatibility
- **Problem**: React 19 with Next.js 15.2.4 caused deployment issues on Vercel
- **Solution**: Downgraded to React 18.3.1 for better stability and compatibility

### 2. Next.js Configuration
- **Problem**: Missing Vercel-specific optimizations
- **Solution**: Updated `next.config.mjs` with:
  - Proper image optimization settings
  - Trailing slash configuration
  - Rewrite rules for better routing

### 3. Vercel Configuration
- **Problem**: No Vercel-specific deployment settings
- **Solution**: Added `vercel.json` with proper build commands and framework detection

## Deployment Steps

1. **Connect to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect Next.js

2. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - Add any environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - No additional variables required for basic deployment

3. **Build Settings**:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

## Files Modified

- `package.json`: Updated React versions
- `next.config.mjs`: Added Vercel optimizations
- `vercel.json`: Added Vercel configuration
- `.gitignore`: Already properly configured

## Verification

The project now builds successfully locally and should deploy without issues on Vercel. All pages are statically generated for optimal performance.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
3. Verify that the build completes successfully locally
4. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
